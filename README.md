# Call for a fork of the Linux kernel developers community

## TL;DR Summary

This document calls for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a> of the developers’ community of the
[Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), focused on
friendliness and respect among the participants and constant advocacy against
disrespect and the unnecessary use of strong language and personal insults.

This is intended as a way to offset the hostility of some posts on
the [Linux kernel developers mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_mailing_list) and other vger.kernel.org-based
Internet forums, which is tolerated there and considered necessary and
beneficial.

## The problem

### Evidence:

* [Tweet by @shlomif](https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1021089751741419521) - «I may be tactless sometimes in my online comm, but I dont think it is good when I am, and I'm trying to improve. OTOH, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds … seems to be in denial that his insulting posts are doing a lot of damage, and thinks some ppl deserve this treatment. This is bad.»

### The Risk

One project I know ( http://www.gimp.org/ , which I have little doubt that it
is of significant importance ) had been suffering from lack of contributors
and active development effort because of hostility on the part of the existing
developers which has
driven away most potential developers. Eventually, it was [brought to their attention](http://www.gimpusers.com/forums/gimp-developer/5878-rudeness-on-gimp-devel-and-bugzilla-was-re-tools) and the situation improved, but a lot of damage had already been done.

The Linux kernel project faces a similar risk:

* [Increasing age of core contributors](http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2016-January/013941.html)
* Lack of female attendees in the Linux Kernel Summit.

Like it or not most people do not like being treated with [insults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult),
[ad hominems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem),
strong language, disrespect, threats, and Internet force such as forum
kicks or bans. While we expect a well managed collaborative project to reject
many proposed changesets or ask for their revision before incorporating
them (see [this page](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Never_Try_to_Please_Everyone/)), one can get
one's message across and more effectively with more friendliness and tact.

Note: this is <b>not alarmism</b>. We are not saying the Linux kernel project
is doomed. All we are saying is that the situation is not ideal and can be
improved.

## The proposed solution

As noted above, it seems some of the Linux core developers not only practise
hostility, but encourage it and think it is beneficial, even after they were
called on it. We propose establishing a parallel Internet-based community of
forums (not necessarily web forums.), where:

1. Friendliness and respect will be encouraged.

2. Hostility and disrespect will be discouraged and criticised.

3. If a poster continuously exhibits hostility toward his peers, they will be
put on moderation. Normally, they will not be completely blocked.

[Spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) naturally will be filtered and blocked, but it should not purposely affect well-intending users.

The forked community will accept, review and apply patches/["pull-requests"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) or similar changesets, in
several
git-based open source forks of the kernel.org projects. It will routinely pull
changesets from the kernel.org repositories, and optionally submit such for
inclusion in kernel.org, and the LKML contributors will be free to incorporate
changesets from the forks.

Reportedly, Torvalds purposely designed [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
so that forking will be easy, so he deserves credit for his openness and insight.
