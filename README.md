# Call for a fork of the Linux kernel developers community

## TL;DR Summary

This document calls for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a> of the developers’ community of the
[Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), focused on
friendliness and respect among the participants and constant advocacy against
disresect and the unnecessary use of strong language and personal insults.

This is intended as a way to offset the hostility of some posts on
the [Linux kernel developers mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_mailing_list) and other vger.kernel.org-based
Internet forums, which is tolerated there and considered necessary and
beneficial.

## The problem

### The Risk

One project I know ( http://www.gimp.org/ , which I have little doubt that it
is of significant importance ) had been suffering from lack of contributors
and active development effort because of hostility on the part of the existing
developers which has
driven away most potential developers. Eventually, it was [brought to their attention](http://www.gimpusers.com/forums/gimp-developer/5878-rudeness-on-gimp-devel-and-bugzilla-was-re-tools) and the situation improved, but a lot of damage had already been done.

The Linux kernel project faces a similar risk:

* [Increasing age](http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2016-January/013941.html)
* Lack of female attendees in the Linux Kernel Summit.
