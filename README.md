# Call for a fork of the Linux kernel developers community

## TL;DR Summary

This document calls for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a> of the developersâ€™ community of the
[Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), focused on
friendliness and respect among the participants and constant advocacy against
disresect and the unnecessary use of strong language and personal insults.

This is intended as a way to offset the hostility of some posts on
the [Linux kernel developers mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_mailing_list) and other vger.kernel.org-based
Internet forums, which is tolerated there and considered necessary and
beneficial.
